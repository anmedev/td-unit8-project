## Description
This repository contains my code for the Unit 8 project in the Treehouse Techdegree curriculum. This project uses SQLite and the SQL ORM -- along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- to create a web application that will include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. This web application serves as a way for a "local library" to dynamically update and manage its database.

## Known Bugs
